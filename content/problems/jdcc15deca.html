<p>On New Year's Eve, a popular tradition is to have a countdown to midnight. Starting at some number \(N\), people count down from \(N\) to 0 and then burst into celebration. Your task is to write a program that simulates this countdown.</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="h2-responsive">Input</h2>

<p>The first line of input provides the number of test cases, \(T\) \((1 \le T \le 100)\). \(T\) test cases follow. Each test case consists of one integer \(N\) \((1 \le N \le 100)\). </p>

<h2 class="h2-responsive">Output</h2>

<p>For each test case, your program should output one line containing the countdown, which consists of \(N+1\) space-separated integers ending with an exclamation point. </p>
