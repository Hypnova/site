  <p>Samantha is selling food at food day. A buyer givers her \(X\) cents and she must give change back. However, the coins she is working with are not normal coins. Their values are not like loonies and quarters. Their values are each different number of cents. You need to help Samantha make the cents make sense so that she can figure out how many different ways can she make change with the cents that do not make sense. However, Samantha may not have the correct change. In this case, it is impossible to make the correct change. </p>

  <h2 class="h2-responsive">Input</h2>
  
  <p>The first line will contain \(5\) integers that will be the values of coin \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), and \(E\) in that order and in cents. Then, the next line will be the cost of the item in cents. The last line is the amount given to you in cents. The buyer will always pay more than the cost of the item. </p>

  <h2 class="h2-responsive">Output</h2>
  
  <p>You must output the number of different ways Samantha can make change. If she is unable, output \(0\).</p>
