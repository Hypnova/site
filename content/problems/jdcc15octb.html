<p>The school year has just begun, and your programming team needs to hold elections for their two new co-presidents, one boy and one girl. After the elections occur and the votes are tallied, you have a list of the candidates and how many votes they received. Who won the election? </p>

<hr>

<h2 class="h2-responsive">Input</h2>

<p>The first line of the input provides the number of test cases, \(T\) \((1 \le T \le 100)\). \(T\) test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer \(N\) \((1 \le N \le 1000)\), the number of students running for co-president. \(3 \times N\) lines follow (3 for each student), the first of which contains the student's name, the second of which contains <code>M</code> or <code>F</code>, their gender, and the last contains an integer \(V\) \((1 \le V \le 1000)\), the number of votes they receive.  </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> No two students will have the same number of votes, and there will be at least one boy and one girl.</p>

<h2 class="h2-responsive">Output</h2>

<p>For each test case, output one line containing the name of the female co-president and male co-president, separated by a space. </p>
