  <p>For this problem, all combinations of cards given out will have to be simulated in an efficient manner. We can keep three global boolean variables, the \(i^{th}\) representing whether or not it is possible for Hypnova to receive a card of color \(i\).</p>
  
  <p>A DFS or BFS can be used to simulate the giving out of the cards and all the possibilities. This will give \(20 \%\) of the points.</p>
  
  <p>For a full score, dynamic programming must be used to avoid repeating possibilities. The state would be \(3\) integers representing the number of people with colors \(1\), \(2\) and \(3\).</p>
  
  <p>We simply mark each state as visited as we go, and if we encounter a state that is already visited, we do not retraverse that possibility.</p>
  
  <p>As the total number of people can go up to \(10^5\), we cannot use a 3D array to store the states, as that approach would exceed the memory limit. Instead, we must use a set to store the visited states (which can be stored as an object).</p>
