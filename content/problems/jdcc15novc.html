<p>You have been hired by a dating site to code their incredibly advanced matching algorithm. The site has found that the best indicator of a good couple is how many letters their names share: the more the better! </p>

<p>For example, <code>Charles</code> and <code>Kate</code> share two letters: they are an okay match. <code>John</code> and <code>Johnina</code>, on the other hand, share four letters: they are a great match! Given a person and a list of potential partners, find the best match. </p>

<hr>

<h2 class="h2-responsive">Input</h2>

<p>The first line of the input provides the number of test cases, \(T\) \((1 \le T \le 100)\). \(T\) test cases follow. Each test case begins with a string \(S\), a person's name, and \(N\) \((1 \le N \le 1000)\), the number of potential partners. \(N\) lines follow, each containing one name. The names will appear in alphabetical order and will be entirely capitalized. </p>

<h2 class="h2-responsive">Output</h2>

<p>For each test case, output the name of the best partner. If multiple partners share the same number of letters with the person, output the name which comes first alphabetically. </p>

<h2 class="h2-responsive">Sample Input</h2>

<pre class="language-none"><code>2
SARAH 3
AARON
ASHLEY
SAHAR
MEAGAN 3
ANDREW
ANN
JANE
</code></pre>

<h2 class="h2-responsive">Sample Output</h2>

<pre class="language-none"><code>SAHAR
ANDREW
</code></pre>

<h2 class="h2-responsive">Explanation for Sample Output</h2>

<p>In the first test case, Sarah shares three letters (<code>a</code>, <code>r</code>, <code>a</code>) with Aaron, three (<code>s</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>h</code>) with Ashley, and five letters with Sahar, so Sahar is the best match. </p>

<p>In the second test case, Meagan shares three letters (<code>e</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>n</code>) with Andrew, two (<code>a</code>, <code>n</code>) with Ann, and three (<code>e</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>n</code>) with Jane. Since Andrew's name comes first alphabetically, he's chosen as the best match. </p>
