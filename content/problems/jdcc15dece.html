<p>On New Year's Eve, the city of Toronto hosts a fireworks show. The show lasts \(N\) seconds, over the course of which \(M\) fireworks are used. Each firework goes off at a certain time \(A\), hangs in the air for \(L\) seconds, and has a brightness of \(B\). That means that between time \(A\) and \(A+L-1\) (inclusive), the brightness of the sky increases by \(B\).</p>

<p>Given \(A\), \(L\), and \(B\) for each firework, figure out at which point in time is the sky the brightest. </p>

<hr>

<h2 class="h2-responsive">Input</h2>

<p>The first line of the input provides the number of test cases, \(T\) \((1 \le T \le 100)\). \(T\) test cases follow. Each test case begins with two integers \(N\) \((1 \le N \le 10^7)\) and \(M\) \((1 \le M \le 10^4)\). \(M\) lines follow, each containing three integers \(A\), \(L\), and \(B\). </p>

<p>\(1 \le A, L \le 10^7\) \(1 \le B \le 1000\)</p>

<h2 class="h2-responsive">Output</h2>

<p>For each test case, your program should output one integer: the time at which the sky is the brightest. If there are multiple points in time at which the sky is brightest, output the time of the last one. </p>

5 3

2 4 1

7

<h2 class="h2-responsive">Explanation for Sample Output</h2>

<p>In the second test case, the brightness of the sky, starting at \(t = 1\) second, is \(\{3, 3, 3, 7, 4, 4, 9, 5, 5, 5\}\), so the sky is brightest in the \(7^{th}\) second.</p>
