  <p>It is highly recommended to read the <a href="http://mcpt.ca/learn/ds/deque">deque</a> lesson first, as it covers the main operations of a queue. This lesson covers the usage of queue in programming problems.</p>
  
  <p class="lead">The queue is a FIFO (first in first out) data structure. It allows you to insert and remove elements in the order in which they were inserted. If an element was inserted before another element, then the first element would be removed before the second.</p>
  
  <p>The following is a diagram of a queue. It is depicted as a linear structure. The <em>first</em> element is called the front. It is the next element to be removed. Conversely, the <em>last</em> element is called the back. It is the most recently inserted element.</p>

  <p>Elements may only be inserted to the back and removed from the front.</p>

  <hr>
  
  <p>To understand how a queue might be used to solve programming problems, let's solve a simple problem:</p>
  
  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    <p>There are \(N\) customers waiting in line, each wanting to buy a certain amount of bread slices. \(Q\) events occur, where each one is one of two types:</p>
    <p>Type 1: A customer goes to the back of the line, with a certain amount of bread slices.</p>
    <p>Type 2: The customer at the front of the line leaves the line, without purchasing any bread.</p>
    
    <p>Your task is to count how many bread slices are sold.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>To solve this problem, use a queue to represent the customers waiting in line, as shown below:</p>
  
  <pre class="language-java"><code>
    import java.util.*;
  
    // create a queue which stores integers, representing the amount of bread slices each customer wants to buy
    Deque&lt;Integer&gt; queue = new ArrayDeque&lt;Integer&gt;();
  </code></pre>
  
  <p>When an event of type 1 occurs, we add the customer to the back of the line. This is shown below in code:</p>
  
  <pre class="language-java"><code>
      // add a customer who wants s slices of bread to the back of the line
      queue.addLast(s);
  </code></pre>
    
  <p>When a type 2 event happens, we remove the customer at the front of the line, as shown below:</p>
  
  <pre class="language-java"><code>
    queue.removeFirst();
  </code></pre>
  
  <p>Finally, after all \(Q\) events are over, we can simply sum up all the bread slices held by customers remaining in the line. This idea is represented in the code snippet below:</p>
  
  <pre class="language-java"><code>
    int total = 0;
    
    while(!queue.isEmpty()) {
      total += queue.removeFirst();
    }
    
    return total;
  </code></pre>

  <h1 class="h1-responsive">Conclusion</h1>
  <hr>
  
  <p>Queues are extremely important data structures that are used in many programming problems, especially in the field of graph theory, where they are most commonly associated with BFS algorithms. While they are rarely the only part of a solution to a problem, they are used as utility data structures in many solutions.</p>
