  <p>Notice that for a card with a wild factor of \(W\) to be removed from the game, a card with a wild factor of \(K - W\) must also exist. Therefore, we need a fast way to search for a given card. Use a map to store the cards, with the key value being the wild factor and the value being the frequency of that card on the board.</p>
  
  <p>After the map is set up, simply simulate the game, keeping track of the pairs made and removing cards from the game until a winner is found.</p>

  <p>\(\mathcal{O}(N)\), since simulating the game can be done by iterating through all the cards and map access is \(\mathcal{O}(1)\).</p>
