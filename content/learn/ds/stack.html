  <h1>Stack</h1>
  <hr>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <p>It is highly recommended to read the <a href="http://mcpt.ca/learn/ds/deque">deque</a> lesson first, as it covers the main operations of a stack. This lesson covers the usage of stacks in programming problems.</p>
  
  <p class="lead">The stack is a LIFO (last in first out) data structure. It allows you to insert and remove elements in the reverse order of which they were inserted. The last element inserted is the next element to be removed.</p>
  
  <p>The following is a diagram of a stack. It is depicted as a linear structure. The last element inserted is called the <em>top</em>.</p>

  <p>Elements may only be inserted into and removed from the top.</p>

  <hr>
  To understand how a stack might be used to solve programming problems, let's solve a simple problem:
  
  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    <p>Given a string consisting of only <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> characters, check if all parentheses are nested properly.</p>
    <p>Examples of correctly nested parentheses include: <code>(())</code>, <code>()(()())</code></p>
    <p>Examples of incorrectly nested parentheses include: <code>())</code>, <code>)(()())</code></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>To solve this problem, realize that as you read the expression left-to-right, the most 'recent' open bracket always matches the first close bracket, as shown in the diagram below:</p>
  
  <img class="img-fluid" src="../img/stack2.png"><br>
  
  <p>Using this information, we can form an algorithm. We will iterate through the expression left-to-right. If a <code>(</code> character is encountered, it will be added to the stack. If a <code>)</code> character is encountered, we will remove a <code>(</code> character from the stack, as it has been matched. If there is no <code>(</code> to remove from the stack, it means that the expression is unbalanced. The expression is also unbalanced if the stack still has elements after the iteration is complete.</p>
  
  <p>The following idea is expressed in the code snippet below. The snippet returns <code>true</code> if the expression is balanced and <code>false</code> if it is unbalanced.</p>
  
  <pre class="language-java"><code>
    import java.util.*;
  
    // create a stack which stores objects of type Character
    Deque&lt;Character&gt; stack = new ArrayDeque&lt;Character&gt;();
    
    for(int n = 0; n < expression.length (); n++) {
      // if the character is an opening bracket, add it to the stack
      if(expression.charAt(n) == '(') {
        stack.addFirst('(');
      }
      // if the character is a closing bracket and there is an opening bracket that came before it
      else if(!stack.isEmpty()) {
        stack.removeFirst();
      }
      // if the character is a closing bracket and there are no opening brackets that came before it, the expression is unbalanced
      else {
        return false;
      }
    }
    
    // expression is only balanced if there are no more opening brackets to be matched
    return stack.isEmpty();
  </code></pre>
  
  <p>The above code is a simpler version of algorithms that solve BEDMAS equations. Those algorithms also use a stack to handle order of operations and ensure that the correct answer is found.</p>

<div class="row">
  <h1 class="h1-responsive">Recursion</h1>
  <hr>
  
  <p>The behaviour of recursion closely models how stacks add and remove elements. For example, shown below is a method which recursively calculates the factorial of a given number:</p>
  
  <pre class="language-java"><code>
    public static int factorial(int n) {
      if(n &lt;= 1) {
        return 1;
      }
      
      return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
  </code></pre>
  
  <p>Imagine a stack which holds a list of methods to execute, where the methods at the top of the stack are to be executed first. If <code>factorial(3)</code> is called, it will be added to the stack.</p>
  
  <p>Inside <code>factorial(3)</code>, the method <code>factorial(2)</code> is called. Since the result of <code>factorial(3)</code> depends on <code>factorial(2)</code>, <code>factorial(2)</code> must be executed first, thus it will be placed on top of the stack.</p>
  
  <p><code>factorial(2)</code> will then call the method <code>factorial(1)</code>, which is placed on top of the stack. Since <code>factorial(1)</code> doesn't make any recursive calls, it will return a result of <code>1</code>, and is removed from the top of the stack.</p>
  
  <p><code>factorial(2)</code> is now on top of the stack and since it doesn't make anymore recursive calls, it returns a value of <code>2</code> and is removed from the stack.</p>
  
  <p>Now, just <code>factorial(3)</code> is left on the stack. Finally, <code>factorial(3)</code> is removed from the stack, and a final answer of <code>6</code> is returned.</p>
  
  <p>Because recursive calls can be easily modelled with stacks, any recursive method can be rewritten to avoid recursion, and use a stack instead. Shown below the above <code>factorial()</code> method rewritten to use a stack:</p>
  
  <pre class="language-java"><code>
    public static int factorial(int n) {
      Deque&lt;Integer&gt; stack = new ArrayDeque&lt;Integer&gt;();
      stack.addFirst(n);
      
      int result = 1, curr = 0;
      
      while(!stack.isEmpty()) {
        curr = stack.removeFirst();
        result *= curr;
        
        if(curr &gt; 1) {
          stack.addFirst(curr - 1);
        }
      }
      
      return result;
    }
  </code></pre>
  
  <p>Rewriting a recursive method to use a stack can sometimes avoid stack overflow errors, which can occur for methods which make a large amount of recursive calls.</p>

  <h1 class="h1-responsive">Conclusion</h1>
  <hr>
  
    <p>Stacks are extremely important data structures that are used in many programming problems, especially in the field of graph theory, where they are most commonly associated with DFS based algorithms. While they are rarely the only part of a solution to a problem, they are used as utility data structures in many solutions.</p>
