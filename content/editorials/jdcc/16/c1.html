  <p>One part of the problem is the input. By reading in hours and minutes, make a function that converts hours and minutes to minutes past 9:00. To output, hours is seconds divided by 60, and seconds is second mod 60. This makes the rest of the problem easier. </p>
  
  <p>Store the latest ending time of a meeting so far (initialize to 9:00) and override as necessary. Keep a variable for the amount of wasted time (in seconds). If the current meeting's start time is after the latest ending time, then add the difference to the wasted time. </p>

  <p>When you ask a question, you reduce the amount of possible ages. For example, if you have \(A\) possible ages, and you ask "Are you older than \(B\)?". If the answer is <em>yes</em> then you now have \(A - B\) ages, otherwise you have \(B\) ages. The problem asks, by asking optimal questions, what is the worst case? However, we do not know the optimal strategy, therefore, we must brute force all the possible ways to ask. </p>
  
  <p>When asking, the answer is unknown. Therefore, you figure it out as you go. Try both answers to every question asked and try asking every question on the range. Take the worst cost of the two questions asked and take the best result of all the questions asked on a given range to get the answer for that range. It is important to note that the range of possible ages is not important, but the possible number of ages is (\(1-6\) is the same as \(7-12\) because the age is unknown and any could be the answer). </p>
  
  <p>Brute force alone is insufficient. DP (more specifically 1D DP on the length of the range) is required to speed up the solution. </p>

  <p>Observe that because every single character in the given string must be part of the pattern, it doesn't matter which pattern you find in the string, as long as it repeats throughout. To find the repeated pattern, take the first character of the string and iterate through the string until the next occurrence of it is found.
    
  <p>Here, check if the substring between the two identical characters is the repeated pattern. This can be done by iterating through the string and ensuring that the pattern is repeated throughout (you only need to go through half the string because the pattern is guaranteed to repeat at least twice in the string).</p>
  
  <p>If the pattern is not repeated, this means that the pattern is not between the two identical characters. Keep iterating through the string until the identical character is found again, and perform the pattern check detailed above until the pattern is found.</p>
  
  <p>Once the pattern is found, use simple math to determine how many times the pattern was repeated in the string, and which five characters from the pattern to output.</p>

  <p>\(\mathcal O(N^2)\) because in the worst case, half of the string will be iterated through for each character of the string in the first half of the string. However, such a string does not exist and the true running time is most likely closer to (but not quite) \(\mathcal O(N)\).</p>
