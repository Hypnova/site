  <p>Firstly, note that mod 10 is equivalent to taking the units digit of the number. Then we can experiment with the numbers. </p>

  <p>Let's look at the powers of 1: 1, 1, 1, 1... The pattern is that all the powers of 1 are 1. The same can be seen with 0. Evidently, these two numbers have patterns, cycles of length 1. </p>

  <p>Now, let's consider other digits. How about 2? 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. The units are: 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4... The pattern is {2, 4, 8, 6}, a cycle of length 4! Now let's look at 3: 3, 9, 27, 81, 243. Also a cycle of length 4. In all the digits from 0 to 9, you'll see that there are cycle lengths of 1, 2 and 4. </p>

  <p>We have only considered single digit numbers, but since the alphabet has 26 letters, let us consider two digit numbers. THe first two digit number, 10: 10, 100, 1000. It has the same cycle length as its units digit. This is because when multiplying, the only digit that can affect the units digit, is the units digit. Thus, all the other digits are insignificant and won't affect the cycle length. Meaning, 3, 13 and 23 all have the same cycle length. </p>

  <p>Now that we figured out the trick, there are two ways to implement it. </p>

  <p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Since the cycle lengths are 1, 2 and 4. The LCM of the cycle lengths is 4. Just mod the exponent by 4 before performing the operation. </p>

  <p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Have a hardcoded array of the cycles. </p>

  <pre class="language-cpp"><code>{{0}, {1}, {2, 4, 8, 6}, {3, 9, 7, 1}, {4, 6}, {5}, {6}, {7, 9, 3, 1}, {8, 4, 2, 6}, {9, 1}}</code></pre>
