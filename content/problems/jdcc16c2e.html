  <p>Recently, the moon passed closer to the Earth than it ever has in decades. Hazel, set on seizing the opportunity, stayed up all night to watch the moon through her circular window. Unfortunately, there’s no guarantee that the moon and Hazel’s window perfectly aligned, making it possible that Hazel only saw part of the moon. Can you figure out how much of the moon she saw?</p>
  
  <h2 class="h2-responsive">Input</h2>
    
    <p>Each test case begins with three integers \(X_{w}\), \(Y_{w}\), \(R_{w}\) \((1 \le X_{w}, Y_{w}, R_{w} \le 1000)\), representing a circle centered at \((X_{w}, Y_{w})\) with radius \(R_{w}\), the part of the sky that she could see through her window.</p>
<p>The next line contains three integers \(X_{m}\), \(Y_{m}\), \(R_{m}\) \((1 \le X_{m}, Y_{m}, R_{m} \le 1000)\), the position and radius of the moon in the sky.</p>

  <h2 class="h2-responsive">Output</h2>
  
  <p>For each test case, output the area of the moon that was visible, rounded to two decimal places.</p>
