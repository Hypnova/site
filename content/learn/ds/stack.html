  <h1>Stack</h1>

<div class="row">
  <p class="lead">The stack is a LIFO (last in first out) data structure. It allows you to insert and remove elements in the reverse order of which they were inserted. The last element inserted is the next element to be removed. The recursion stack is similar to the stack in that they are both LIFO. </p>
  
  <p>The following is a diagram of a stack. It is depicted as a linear structure. The last element inserted is called the <em>top</em>. </p>

  <p>Elements may only be inserted into and removed from the top. </p>

  <h1 class="h1-responsive">Features</h1>
  <hr>
  
  <p>An implementation of a stack is provided in most programming languages. In Java, this data structure is defined by both the <code>Deque</code> (stands for double ended queue) interface. While there is a <code>Stack</code> class in Java, it is slow and not used very often. In addition, the <code>Deque</code> class supports more operations (such as insertion and deletion from both the front and back), making it more useful in programming contests.</p>
  
  <p>Note that although <code>Deque</code> supports more operations, only the standard stack operations are covered in this lesson. The other methods are covered in the Deque lesson.</p>
  
  <p>Some operations are supported by multiple methods in the <code>Deque</code> interface. To reduce confusion, only one method is listed for each feature.</p>
  
  <p>It is important to note that all operations below are performed in amortized \(\mathcal{O}(1)\) and that <code>E</code> is the type of object that is stored in the stack.</p>
  
  <h3 class="h3-responsive">Size</h3>
  
  <p><code>int size()</code> – returns the number of elements in the stack. </p>
  
  <p>Alternatively, <code>boolean isEmpty()</code> can be used if the number of elements isn't relevant and only if it's empty or not. </p>
  
  <h3 class="h3-responsive">Insert Front</h3>
  
  <p><code>void push(E e)</code> – element <code>e</code> is added to the front of the stack. This method will throw an exception if <code>e</code> is <code>null</code>.</p>
  
  <h3 class="h3-responsive">Access Front</h3>
  
  <p><code>E peek()</code> – returns the element at the front of the stack. Returns <code>null</code> if the stack is empty.</p>
  
  <h3 class="h3-responsive">Remove Front</h3>
  
  <p><code>E pop()</code> - returns and removes the element at the front of the stack. Throws an exception if the stack is empty.</p>

  <h1 class="h1-responsive">Usage</h1>
  <hr>
  
  <p><code>ArrayDeque</code> is a class which implements the methods in the <code>Deque</code> class that were shown above. Although the <code>LinkedList</code> class also implements the above methods, it is almost always slower than an <code>ArrayDeque</code> and is not recommended.</p>
  
  <pre class="language-java"><code>
    // create a stack which stores objects of type Integer
    Deque&lt;Integer&gt; stack = new ArrayDeque&lt;Integer&gt;();
    
    // stack now contains the elements 5 4 3 2 1 (in that order)
    for(int n = 1; n &lt;= 5; n++) {
      stack.push(n);
    }
    
    if(stack.peek() == 1 && stack.size() == 5) {
        while(!stack.isEmpty()) {
          System.out.print(stack.pop() + " ");
        }
    }
  </code></pre>
  
  <p>Output:</p>
  
  <pre class="language-none"><code>5 4 3 2 1 </code></pre>

  <h1 class="h1-responsive">Applications</h1>
  <hr>
  
    <p>Stacks are extremely important data structures that are used in many programming problems, especially in the field of graph theory, where they are most commonly associated with DFS algorithms. While they are rarely the only part of a solution to a problem, they are used as utility data structures in many solutions.</p>
